# Introduction

In this project, using a dataset containing six months information, we want to create a model that predicts credit card defaults. From a risk management perspective, an accurate prediction and assessment of the credit risk is of relevant importance for the bank issuing the credit card.
The dataset we are going to use can be downloaded at the following url:
"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00350/default%20of%20credit%20card%20clients.xls".
We have downloaded and manually saved a version of the *.xlsx* file in the "data" subfolder you can find within the github repo link we have provided together with the three files or at the following ulr:
"https://github.com/andrearoetti/Choose-Your-Own/tree/master/data".
Before getting started, we load the necessary packages for our work, after installing them in case they are not installed yet.

```{r installing, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

if (!require(tidyverse)) install.packages('tidyverse')
if (!require(lattice)) install.packages('lattice')
if (!require(caret)) install.packages('caret')
if (!require(readxl)) install.packages('readxl')
library(tidyverse)
library(lattice)
library(caret)
library(readxl)
```

We therefore use here below a relative path in order to read the excel file in R: for the sake of simplicity, we will simply call the dataset **credit_card**.

```{r read the file, message = FALSE}

credit_card <- read_xlsx("data/default of credit card clients.xlsx")
```
